a.Difference between Browser JS and Node JS:

Browser JS                                                                                            Node JS
1.Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website.               NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.
2.Javascript can only be run in the browsers.	                                                        We can run Javascript outside the browser with the help of NodeJS.
3.It is basically used on the client-side.	                                                          It is mostly used on the server-side.
4.Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.                                     Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
5.Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.     V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs Javascript.
